git-ftp.py : quick and efficient publishing of Git repositories over FTP

Some web hosts only give you FTP access to the hosting space, but
you would still like to use Git to version the contents of your
directory.  You could upload a full tarball of your website every
time you update but that's wasteful.  git-ftp.py only uploads the
files that changed.

Requirements: git-python 3.x <http://gitorious.org/git-python>
