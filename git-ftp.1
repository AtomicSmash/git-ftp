.SH "NAME"
git-ftp \- Quick and efficient publishing of Git repositories over FTP


.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit ftp\fR [(\-\-force | \-f)] [(\-\-quiet | \-q)]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Some web hosts only give you FTP access to the hosting space, but you would
still like to use Git to version the contents of your directory. You could
upload a full tarball of your website very time you update, but that's
wasteful. \fIgit ftp\fR only uploads the files that changed.


.SH "OPTIONS"

.PP
\-f, \-\-force
.RS 4
Force the reupload of all files instead of just the changed ones\&.
.RE

.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
Display only errors and warnings\&.
.RE

.PP
\-r, \-\-revision
.RS 4
The SHA of the current revision is stored in \fIgit-rev.txt\fR on the server.
Use this revision instead of the server stored one, to determine whch files
have changed\&.
.RE

.PP
\-c, \-\-commit
.RS 4
Upload this commit instead of HEAD or the tip of the selected branch\&.
.RE

.PP
\-b, \-\-branch
.RS 4
Use this branch instead of the active one\&.
.RE


.SH "FTP CREDENTIALS"
.sp
You can place FTP credentials in \fI.git/ftpdata\fR, as such:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[master]
username=me
password=s00perP4zzw0rd
hostname=ftp.hostname.com
remotepath=/htdocs
ssl=yes

[staging]
username=me
password=s00perP4zzw0rd
hostname=ftp.hostname.com
remotepath=/htdocs/staging
ssl=no
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Each section corresponds to a Git branch. If you don't create the configuration
file, \fIgit ftp\fR will interactively prompt you.
.sp
FTP SSL support needs Python 2.7 or later.
